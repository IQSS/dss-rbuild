# packageguidelines
For IQSS

This is still under development, but the second draft is finished!

## Aims

This aims to create guidelines to help individuals develop packages using R. It runs through the following:

## Contents

[Introduction](amspector100.github.io/packageguidelines/)

[Package Development](amspector100.github.io/packageguidelines/package-development.html)

[Version Control](amspector100.github.io/packageguidelines/version-control.html)

[IDEs](amspector100.github.io/packageguidelines/a-note-on-ides.html)

[resources](amspector100.github.io/packageguidelines/resources.html)

This repo also includes the *devex* package in a subdirectory, which serves as a very simple example of a package in R. You can find it [at this link](https://github.com/amspector100/packageguidelines/tree/master/devex). 

For more information about the guide, see the [Introduction](./index.Rmd). For more information about the devex package, see either the DESCRIPTION file or the Readme in [this subdirectory](https://github.com/amspector100/packageguidelines/tree/master/devex). 

## To-do

0. Add a floating link to the example package
1. Some information may still be platform  dependent
2. Eventually maybe add some kind of workflow for publishing packages

### Questions

1. Build/publicize sections okay?
2. No vignette section for now
