### 0. To-do

## 1. Why should you test?

Suppose Grace has created a package and have been using it for a while, but she decides she'd like to modify one function to improve it. She modifies her function, tests it a bit, and then pushes her package to git. Yet two weeks later, Carlos discovers that the changes she made created a bug in *another* function in the package! This situation is very annoying, especially if Carlos has no idea what has caused the bug or how to fix it. 

The solution to problems like this is to testing your package *systematically* and *automatically*. If Grace had rigorously tested the entire package before pushing it to git, Carlos would never have had to deal with the new bug- Grace would have found out immediately. In other words, a good principle in package devleopment is to make sure your code *fails as fast as possible,* so you can find out and fix it. Of course, all programmers test their code, but not everyone tests systematically and automatically. 

In this guide, we'll broadly talk about three kinds of tests. First, we'll talk creating automatic *unit tests*, which are tests of individual blocks of code (usually individual functions or classes). Then, we'll talk about *integration tests*, which are tests of how individual blocks of code work in combination. Lastly, we'll talk about making your package *developer-proof* - i.e. if you have collaborators, or someone tries to fix your package, you can proactively prevent them from breaking anything important. 

## 2. Unit Tests

### 2.1: What are unit tests?

__ this answer is not really descriptive __

Tests in general compare the actual output of a block of code to its expected output. For example, the following test tests whether the "generalized square root" function actually returns $2$ as the square root of $4$.   

```{r, eval=FALSE}
expect_equal(general_sqrt(4), complex(real = 2, imaginary = 0))
```

*Unit tests* usually run automatically on the computer of the developer who is modifying a package - for example, if Grace is updating her package, unit tests on her updates will run on her computer. 

We'll talk a little more about how exactly to create tests down below, but hopefully this makes the general concept clear (you've also probably been using the general concept as you program). 

### 2.2: Setting up the testing environment

Creating unit tests is actually quite easy, thanks to a package called 'testtthat' which works in combination with devtools. To begin, you should make 'testthat' is installed by running the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('testthat')
```

Next, you'll want to make sure R recognizes you're working on a package (you can do this by navigating to the .Rproj file in the 'files' tab in the bottom right corner of RStudio and clicking on it). Then, you can run the following command in the console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::use_testthat()
```

This will do a couple of things. First, it will add 'testthat' to the Suggests part of the DESCRIPTION, which will help other collaborators know to use testthat when modifying/working on the package. It will also create a 'tests/testthat' directory in your project, as well a file called 'test/testthat.R', as shown below.

### 2.3: Expectations

Before understanding what a unit test is, we need to properly describe an expectation. An expectation tests whether the actual output of a single function call is what the developer expected. The 'testthat' package has a number of functions which compare outputs to expected values. When calling one of these functions, one of two things can happen:

1. If the actual output matches the expectation, nothing will happen!
2. If the actual output does not match the expectation, it will throw an error. 

For example, 'expect_equal()' uses the base R function 'all.equal()' to check whether an output is (approximately) equal to an expectation. In the following code, the first function call will do nothing - the second function call will throw an error, displayed below. 

```{r, eval = FALSE, error = TRUE}
library(testthat)
testthat::expect_equal(2, 2)
testthat::expect_equal(2, 4)
```
![](Images/TestSS/expectationerror.PNG)

Here's an (abbreviated) list of the expectation functions:

1. **expect_equal**, as aforementioned, checks equality using the "all.equal()" base function.
2. **expect_identical** checks equality using the "identical()" base function. Generally, it's better to use "expect_equal" because lots of R functions use numerical approximations which will cause expect_identical to fail when you don't want it to. 
3. **expect_match**, **expect_output**, **expect_message**, **expect_warning**, and **expect_error** all respectively test whether a string, output, warning, or error match a regular expression. For example, the following two expectations functions will not throw errors:

```{r}
testthat::expect_match('hello1234', 'hello')
testthat::expect_warning(sqrt(-2), 'NaNs produced')
```
respectively because 'hello1234' contains 'hello', and because the error message produced by sqrt(-2) contains the phrase 'NaNs produced'.

4. **expect_is** tests whether an object inherets from a class, specified in quotes. For example, the following test passes:

```{r}
testthat::expect_is(sqrt(2), 'numeric')
```

5. **expect_true** and **expect_false** respectively expect a statement to evaluate to true or false.

### 2.4: Structure of unit tests

Each *unit test* (which is written in an R script) should use a couple of expectations to test a single core function. It should use the function "test_that" (from the "testthat" package). "test_that" takes two parameters: a string, which describes the test, and a couple of expectations, surrounded by curly braces. For example, the following code will test whether the general_sqrt function from the devex package returns a complex number. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
test_that("Returns complex number", {
  expect_is(general_sqrt(-2), 'complex')
  expect_is(general_sqrt(2), 'complex')
  expect_is(general_sqrt(0), 'complex')
})
```

Multiple tests with similar functions should be put in the same file, and those test files must be put in the tests/testthat/ directory. Moreover, their name must start with the word 'test' - this will help RStudio automatically run your tests for you.  For example, in the devex package, there are two very simple helper functions ('general_sqrt' and 'loss') and one moderately complex function ('scalep'). As a result, the devex package has exactly two testing files: one called 'testhelpers,' which tests the helper functions, and another called 'testscalep', which tests the scalep function. The testhelpers file looks like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devex)
context("generalized sqrt and loss")

# Generalized sqrt ---------------------------------------

test_that("Returns complex number", {
  expect_is(general_sqrt(-2), 'complex')
  expect_is(general_sqrt(2), 'complex')
  expect_is(general_sqrt(0), 'complex')
})

test_that("Returns correct sqrt", {
  expect_equal(general_sqrt(-1.53), complex(real = 0, imaginary = sqrt(1.53)))
  expect_equal(general_sqrt(-2), complex(real = 0, imaginary = sqrt(2)))
})

test_that("Warnings for vectors of length > 1", {
  expect_warning(general_sqrt(c(2, 0)))
  expect_warning(general_sqrt(c(-2, 0, 2)), 'NaNs produced')
})

# Loss ---------------------------------------------------

test_that("Returns correct loss", {
  expect_equal(loss(0, 3, 9)
  expect_equal(loss(c(1, 1, 1), c(1, 2, 3)), c(0, 1, 4))
  expect_equal(loss(c(-1, -5, -2), c(0, 0, 0)), c(1, 25, 4))
})

```

Each test file, as demonstrated above, needs to load the package of interest (using 'library' is fine) and also should supply a string which succinctly describes the general purpose of all of the tests in the test file to the 'context' function. 

You can run all of the tests in the test/testthat directory by clicking Build>Check Package or Control Shift E. If any test throws an error, RStudio will report two things. First, it will report the string given in the test which was given to the 'test_that' function call. Second, it will report the filename of the test file as well as the line of code that threw an error. For example, running the above tests yields the following result:

![](Images/TestSS/testthaterror1.PNG)

This indicates that line 18 of testhelpers.R failed in the test "Warnings for vectors of length > 1." Looking at the test code reveals that the general_sqrt function does not return a warning for positive vectors of length greater than one.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
expect_warning(general_sqrt(c(2, 0)))
```

To fix this, it might be worth adding in an extra line or two which ensures that the input to general_sqrt is as it should be (in order to prevent users from getting unexpected results).

### 2.5: Tips for making good tests

Good tests have a couple of characteristics.

**First**, good tests have high *coverage,* meaning that they test a large percentage of the lines of code of the package. For example, the code for the general_sqrt function is as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# This function takes the complex square root of real numbers

general_sqrt <- function (x){
  
  # Issue warning for longer vectors
  if (length(x) > 1) {
    warning('Argument of general_sqrt has length greater than 1')
  }

  # Return the normal square root if x > 0
  if (x > 0 || x == 0){
    return(complex(real = sqrt(x), imaginary = 0))
  }

  # Else return the complex square root

  else {
    return(complex(real = 0, imaginary = sqrt(-x)))
  }

}

```

The following test has low coverage for the general_sqrt function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
test_that("Returns correct sqrt", {
  expect_equal(general_sqrt(-1.53), complex(real = 0, imaginary = sqrt(1.53)))
  expect_equal(general_sqrt(-2), complex(real = 0, imaginary = sqrt(2)))
})

```

because it only tests whether general_sqrt returns the correct square root for negative numbers. This test thus only covers half of the code in general_sqrt, because the mechanism for dealing with nonnegative numbers is entirely separate. The following test is a better example, because it tests both positive and negative numbers.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

test_that("Returns correct sqrt", {
  expect_equal(general_sqrt(1.53), complex(real = sqrt(1.53), imaginary = 0))
  expect_equal(general_sqrt(-2), complex(real = 0, imaginary = sqrt(2)))
})

```

**Second*, it's important to remember that coverage is only important because tests with high coverage tend to test all the different functionalities of a package. It's possible to have tests which have very high coverage but aren't great tests. Consider the following example.

```{r}

print_it <- function(text){
  print('hello')
}

testthat::expect_warning(print_it('hi'), NA)

```

This expectation has 100% coverage because it will run every line of code (the expectation will also pass because no warning will be thrown). However, it's not sufficient alone because it doesn't actually test whether print_it returns the desired output: in this case, print_it will always print 'hello'. In other words, the expectation does not test all of the functionality of the function.

**Third**, tests should run relatively quickly, if possible. Sometimes, it's okay to maximize coverage even if you don't test every single functionality to save time, because *usually* high coverage ensures you test most of the functionality of the package. This is particularly true because lots of integrated testing software (which we'll discuss in integrated tests) will not be able to easily run tests which take too long. More on that later. 

**Fourth**, tests should be clear to the reader, because sometimes there are bugs in tests too. If others eventually help develop or maintain your packages, they'll want to know what it means when a test fails. Moreover, for large packages, you yourself may have trouble remembering the exact details of every test you've written. Making tests clear will help. In practice, this your tests should return clear error messages and be readable. For example, the following test is a bad example, for two reasons:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

sigmoid <- function(x, a, b){
  return(exp(a*x)/(exp(a*x) + b))
}

test_that('sigmoid output', {
  expect_equal(sigmoid(0.3068528, 1, 1.3591409), 0.5, 10^-7)
})

```

The string 'sigmoid output' does not describe the purpose of the test, which is to test the precision of the sigmoid output. This means that if the test fails, it will be hard to tell what's wrong. Additionally, the purpose of the test is not clear to begin with - what do the seemingly random decimals mean? At the very least, it's probably worth putting comments in explaining the point of the test, as shown below.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

sigmoid <- function(x, a, b){
  return(exp(a*x)/(exp(a*x) + b))
}

test_that('test sigmoid precision', {
  
  # Check sigmoid(ln(e/2), ln(e/2), e/2) is very close to 1/2.

  expect_equal(sigmoid(0.3068528, 1, 1.3591409), 0.5, 10^-7)
})

```

This test is a bit more interpretable and delivers a better error message.

### 2.6: Automated Checks

The control + shift + E automated check function of RStudio is really wonderful. It's worth noting that every check it performs is relatively important, and if RStudio signals any warnings or errors, it's definitely worth fixing them. It's also probably worth fixing any "notes" it issues. You can read more about what each type of check in the automated check does, but suffice to say it will run all of your tests for you as well as a few more to make sure your package is well put together. Read more about the automated check (here)[http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/check.html#check].

## 3. Integrated Tests

Up to this point, you probably have not been pushing to Github too often. However, in large projects/packages where many programmers are working on the same package at once, it's important to ensure each programmer continuously commits changes to github to make sure all the changes are compatible with each other. This process of rapid updating of packages is referred to as *continuous integration*, and it can be very difficult to manage properly (it is sometimes referred to as *integration hell*, specifically because developers often waste lots of hours trying to make code integrate properly). Thankfully, there are two wonderful free continuous integration services that will make your life a lot easier. If you're using windows, you'll want to use the service called *Appveyor* - if you're using Mac or Linux, you'll want to use the service called *Travis CI*. 

Step 1: Go to Travis/Appveyor, sign up
 
Step 2: Enable on Github

Step 3: Run devtools::use_appveyor() or devtools::use_travis()

Step 4: Adapt
